    <p>The antiSMASH database offers researchers four main pieces of funtionality.</p>
    <p>
        It is possible to browse the database by phylogeny or secondary metabolite type, giving an
        exploratory overview of the avaliable biosynthetic gene cluster predictions. Selecting a
        cluster for closer inspection will redirect to the antiSMASH results page, offering all the
        usual annotations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alteratively, it is possible to query for specific biosynthetic gene cluster types, monomers
        and many more. The "build a query" page allows to construct complicated, detailed queries in
        an easy manner.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to find BGC regions containing protein sequences similar to a protein you are
        interested in, or containing a RiPP core peptide similar to a core peptide you are
        interested in, the protein sequence search is the tool to used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, a number of summary statistics are available to give a general idea of the types of
        secondary metabolite production represented by the database.
